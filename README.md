### Components used in the project:
- Battery (11.1V)
- Motors (2)
- NodeMCU (ESP8266)
- Motor Driver (1)
- Bread Board (1)
- Jumper Wires (male and female)
- Body of the robot (main body, tires...)

## Steps to be followed:
- **Step 1-** Check whether the motor driver is giving the required output (around 9V).
    - powering Arduino Uno and Motor Driver seperately..
